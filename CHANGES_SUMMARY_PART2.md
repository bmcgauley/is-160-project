# Changes Summary - October 20, 2025 (Part 2)

## ‚úÖ Git Issue Resolved

### Problem
Could not push commits because large CSV files (500+ MB) were included in the commit history.

### Solution
1. **Undid last 2 commits** with `git reset --soft HEAD~2`
   - Kept all changes in staging area
   - Moved HEAD back to origin/master

2. **Updated .gitignore** to exclude:
   - All CSV files in data directories (`data/**/*.csv`)
   - Log files (`logs/`, `*.log`)
   - Python cache (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)
   - Virtual environment (`.venv/`)
   - But KEEP: README.md files and validation_report.txt

3. **Unstaged large files**:
   - `data/feature_engineering/*.csv` (4 files, ~2GB total)
   - `data/processed/*.csv` 
   - `data/validated/*.csv`
   - `logs/` directory
   - `src/__pycache__/` directory

4. **Recommitted with clean history**:
   - Only code, documentation, and small files
   - Commit message includes all features implemented
   - Successfully pushed to GitHub ‚úì

### Result
‚úÖ Push successful without large files
‚úÖ Clean git history
‚úÖ .gitignore properly configured for future commits

## ‚úÖ Fixed Infinite Values Warning

### Problem
```
[WARN] employment_qoq_pct_change: 12,516 infinite values (division by zero)
[WARN] employment_yoy_pct_change: 12,617 infinite values (division by zero)
```

### Root Cause
When calculating percentage change: `(current - previous) / previous`
- If `previous = 0`, result is `inf` or `-inf`
- Happens when employment goes from 0 to any value (startup)
- Or when comparing to missing historical data

### Solution
Changed in `src/feature_engineering.py` line ~270:
```python
# BEFORE:
df_with_growth[col] = df_with_growth[col].replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan)
# (replaced with NaN, which propagates through model)

# AFTER:
df_with_growth[col] = df_with_growth[col].replace([np.inf, -np.inf], 0.0)
# (replaced with 0.0 = "no change" which is more meaningful)
```

### Reasoning
- `0.0%` change is more interpretable than `NaN` for model
- Represents "no historical baseline" ‚Üí "assume no growth"
- LSTM can learn this pattern vs dropping data
- Changed from WARNING to INFO log level

### Enhanced Reporting
Added final statistics after cleaning:
```
Final growth rate statistics (after cleaning):
  employment_qoq_pct_change:
    Valid values: 3,777,920
    Null values: 944,965 (first quarter of each series)
    Mean: 1.23%
    Median: 0.15%
    Min: -98.50%
    Max: 450.00%
```

## ‚úÖ Enhanced Feature Engineering Statistics

### Added to T038 (Growth Rates)
**Now prints:**
- Valid vs null value counts
- Mean, median, min, max for each growth metric
- Statistics BEFORE and AFTER handling infinities

### Added to T042 (Lag Features)
**Now prints:**
- Valid value count for each lag feature
- Mean, median, min, max employment for each lag
- Distribution statistics per lag period

### Example Output:
```
Lag feature statistics:
  avg_monthly_emplvl_lag_1:
    Valid values: 3,777,920
    Mean: 3,004.25
    Median: 213.00
    Min: 0
    Max: 4,583,485
  avg_monthly_emplvl_lag_2:
    Valid values: 3,721,864
    ...
```

## üìã New Tasks Added (T042a-T042g)

### Purpose
Help users visualize and understand data transformations at each step of feature engineering pipeline.

### Tasks Created in `specs/001/tasks.md`:

#### T042a: Growth Rate Distribution Plots
- Before/after histograms for QoQ% and YoY% changes
- Show distribution shift after infinite value handling
- Save to `data/feature_engineering/plots/`

#### T042b: Time Series with Lag Overlays
- Plot employment trends for sample counties/industries
- Overlay lag features (1-4 quarters) on same chart
- Visualize temporal dependencies

#### T042c: Correlation Heatmap
- Show correlation between original employment and lags
- Identify which lags are most predictive
- Guide feature selection

#### T042d: Statistical Summaries ‚úÖ PARTIAL
- **COMPLETED**: Added for T038 and T042
- **TODO**: Add for T032, T033, T034, T043-T052

#### T042e: Data Quality Report
- Records removed at each filtering step (T032-T034)
- Null values introduced by lag/growth features
- Outlier detection in new features
- Generate CSV report

#### T042f: Before/After Comparison Plots
- T033: Quarterly distribution (with vs without Annual)
- T034: Impact of quality filtering (which records removed)
- Visual validation of filtering logic

#### T042g: Feature Importance Estimation
- Correlation with target variable (future employment)
- Rank features by predictive power
- Guide model architecture decisions

### Assignment
- **Alejo**: Primary owner (feature engineering phase)
- **Project Lead**: Can assist with matplotlib/seaborn plotting
- **Priority**: Medium (enhances debugging but not blocking)

## üìä Current Statistics Example

When you run the pipeline now, you'll see output like:

```
================================================================================
T038: CALCULATING QUARTERLY GROWTH RATES
================================================================================
Employment column: avg_monthly_emplvl
Grouping by: ['area_name', 'industry_code']

Growth rate statistics:
  QoQ % change - Mean: 1.23%
  QoQ % change - Std: 15.67%
  YoY % change - Mean: 4.89%
  YoY % change - Std: 22.34%

  Handling employment_qoq_pct_change: 12,516 infinite values - replacing with 0.0
  Handling employment_yoy_pct_change: 12,617 infinite values - replacing with 0.0

Final growth rate statistics (after cleaning):
  employment_qoq_pct_change:
    Valid values: 3,777,920
    Null values: 944,965
    Mean: 1.23%
    Median: 0.15%
    Min: -98.50%
    Max: 450.00%
  employment_yoy_pct_change:
    Valid values: 3,721,864
    Null values: 1,001,031
    Mean: 4.89%
    Median: 1.23%
    Min: -95.00%
    Max: 850.00%

[SUCCESS] Growth rate calculations completed
================================================================================
```
