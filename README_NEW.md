# IS-160 Project: RNN/LSTM Employment Forecasting with QCEW Data

A deep learning project that uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to analyze and forecast employment trends from California's Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data.

## Overview

This project builds a temporal deep learning model that processes sequential employment data including:
- **Temporal patterns**: Quarterly employment changes and seasonal trends
- **Geographic distributions**: County-level employment variations across California
- **Industry classifications**: Sector-specific employment dynamics
- **Wage trends**: Average weekly wage patterns and growth rates

The LSTM architecture is specifically designed for time-series forecasting, capturing long-term dependencies in employment data to predict future quarterly employment levels and wage trends.

## Key Features

- **Unified Pipeline**: Single-click execution from raw data consolidation to trained model predictions
- **Comprehensive Data Processing**: Automatic consolidation of multiple CSV files into master dataset
- **Data Protection**: Raw data files are never modified (read-only access)
- **Rich Visualizations**: Automatic generation of exploration plots (employment trends, wage patterns, industry analysis)
- **Feature Engineering**: Temporal and geographic features capturing economic relationships
- **LSTM Architecture**: Multi-layer LSTM with batch normalization and dropout for robust forecasting
- **Interactive Prediction**: User-friendly interface for making employment forecasts
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for exploration, validation, feature engineering, training, and evaluation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/bmcgauley/is-160-project.git
cd is-160-project

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Setup

**IMPORTANT**: The raw data files have been manually downloaded and placed in `/data/raw/`. These files are our baseline and should NEVER be modified.

Raw data files:
- `qcew_2004-2007.csv`
- `qcew_2008-2011.csv`
- `qcew_2012-2015.csv`
- `qcew_2016-2019.csv`
- `qcew-2020-2022.csv`
- `qcew-2023-2024.csv`

### Running the Pipeline

The master orchestrator `main.py` coordinates the entire pipeline:

```bash
# Run the complete pipeline (consolidation → exploration → validation → features → training → prediction)
python main.py

# Run specific stages
python main.py --stage explore      # Data exploration and visualization
python main.py --stage validate     # Data quality validation
python main.py --stage train        # Model training
python main.py --stage predict      # Interactive prediction interface

# Options
python main.py --skip-plots          # Skip plot generation during exploration
python main.py --force-rebuild       # Force rebuild of consolidated dataset
python main.py --launch-interface    # Launch prediction interface after completion
```

## Pipeline Stages

The pipeline consists of 8 coordinated stages:

### Stage 1: Data Consolidation
- Combines all raw CSV files into a single master dataset
- **Input**: `/data/raw/*.csv`
- **Output**: `/data/processed/qcew_master_consolidated.csv`
- **Protection**: Raw files are never modified

### Stage 2: Data Exploration
- Exploratory data analysis with comprehensive statistics
- **Output**: Exploration visualizations in `/data/processed/plots/`
  - `employment_trends.png` - Total employment over time
  - `quarterly_distribution.png` - Employment by quarter
  - `wage_trends.png` - Average weekly wage trends
  - `top_industries.png` - Top 15 industries by employment

### Stage 3: Data Validation
- Quality checks: missing values, duplicates, value ranges
- Statistical anomaly detection
- **Output**: `/data/validated/qcew_validated.csv`

### Stage 4: Feature Engineering
- Quarter-over-quarter growth rates
- Seasonal adjustment factors
- Industry concentration metrics
- Geographic clustering features
- **Output**: `/data/processed/qcew_features.csv`

### Stage 5: Preprocessing
- Normalization using robust scaling
- Categorical encoding
- Sequence window creation for LSTM
- Train/validation/test splits
- **Output**: `/data/processed/qcew_preprocessed.csv`

### Stage 6: Model Training
- Multi-layer LSTM architecture
- Batch normalization and dropout
- Early stopping and checkpointing
- **Output**: `/data/processed/lstm_model.pt`

### Stage 7: Model Evaluation
- Accuracy metrics (MSE, MAE, MAPE)
- Prediction visualizations
- Baseline comparisons (ARIMA, exponential smoothing)

### Stage 8: Interactive Prediction
- User-friendly forecasting interface
- Multi-step ahead predictions
- Uncertainty bands and confidence intervals
- Industry risk dashboards

## Data Source

The project uses California's [Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)](https://edd.ca.gov/) data (2004-2024), which provides comprehensive employment statistics including:
- Employment counts by industry and geography
- Wage information and averages
- Quarterly updates with 20+ years of historical data
- Statewide California coverage (FIPS 6000)

## Model Architecture

The LSTM employs a time-series forecasting approach:
- **Sequential Processing**: LSTM layers capture temporal dependencies and long-term patterns
- **Batch Normalization**: Stabilizes training and improves convergence
- **Dropout Regularization**: Prevents overfitting on employment sequences
- **Multi-step Prediction**: Forecasts multiple quarters ahead with uncertainty estimates
- **Output**: Dense layers predict employment levels and growth rates

## Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is evaluated using:
- **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- **Directional Accuracy** (correctly predicting growth/decline)
- **Baseline Comparison** vs ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and traditional regression
