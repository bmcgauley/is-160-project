# IS-160 Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Rigorous Data Validation
Rigorous data validation must be performed at each processing step, incorporating automated quality checks to ensure data integrity, accuracy, and reliability throughout the analysis pipeline.

### II. Comprehensive Feature Engineering
Comprehensive feature engineering must leverage domain expertise in employment economics to transform raw data into meaningful, predictive features that capture economic relationships and temporal dynamics.

### III. Reproducible Research
All research and modeling activities must be fully reproducible, utilizing fixed random seeds for stochastic processes and maintaining detailed logging to enable traceability and verification of results.

### IV. Modular PyTorch Implementation
PyTorch implementations must be modular, with clear block-by-block documentation that explains the purpose, inputs, outputs, and logic of each component to facilitate maintenance and collaboration.

### V. Temporal and Geographic Data Handling
Proper handling of temporal and geographic data structures is required for effective convolutional neural network input, ensuring accurate representation of spatio-temporal patterns in employment data.

### VI. Privacy and Statistical Best Practices
Strict adherence to employment data privacy regulations and statistical best practices is mandatory, including anonymization techniques, ethical data usage, and rigorous statistical methodology to protect sensitive information and ensure valid inferences.

## Additional Constraints
All implementations must use Python 3.8+ as the primary language. PyTorch is the required deep learning framework for neural network components. Data processing must incorporate automated validation pipelines. Geographic data must be handled using appropriate spatial libraries (e.g., GeoPandas). Temporal data must preserve chronological ordering and handle time zones correctly.

## Development Workflow
All code changes must undergo peer review. Automated tests, including data validation checks, must pass before merge. Documentation must be updated for any changes affecting public APIs or data processing pipelines. Reproducibility checks must be performed for any modeling changes.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other project practices and guidelines. Amendments require consensus approval from project stakeholders and must include documentation of rationale and impact. All development activities must comply with the stated principles; any deviations require explicit justification and approval. Regular reviews must be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance.
