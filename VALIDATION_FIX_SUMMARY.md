# Validation Stage Fix Summary

## Issue
The pipeline orchestrator was failing when trying to run the validation stage after preprocessing. The error occurred because:
1. The `validate_data_quality()` wrapper function was missing from `validation.py`
2. Several column names in the validation code didn't match the consolidated data schema
3. Method names were inconsistent (e.g., `validate_statistical_anomalies` vs `detect_statistical_anomalies`)

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `validate_data_quality()` Wrapper Function
**File**: `src/validation.py`

Added a new wrapper function that:
- Accepts a DataFrame and output file path
- Runs all validation checks using the QCEWValidator class
- Saves the validated data to the specified output file
- Generates a validation report
- Returns a comprehensive validation summary dictionary

### 2. Fixed Column Name Compatibility Issues
**File**: `src/validation.py`

Updated validation code to handle different column naming conventions:
- `quarter` vs `qtr` - added fallback logic
- `ownership` vs `own_code` - added fallback logic
- `oty_avg_wkly_wage_pct_chg` - added missing column checks to prevent KeyErrors
- `oty_month1_emplvl_pct_chg` - added conditional checks before accessing

### 3. Corrected Method Names
**File**: `src/validation.py`

Fixed method name calls:
- Changed `validate_statistical_anomalies()` to `detect_statistical_anomalies()`
- Removed call to non-existent `validate_temporal_continuity()` - temporal info is extracted from anomaly results
- Changed `generate_quality_scorecards()` to `build_data_quality_scorecards()`

### 4. Updated Pipeline Data Flow
**File**: `src/pipeline_orchestrator.py`

Clarified the pipeline stages order:
1. Consolidate data → `df_consolidated`
2. Explore data (uses `df_consolidated`)
3. Validate data (uses `df_consolidated`, saves to `validated_file`)
4. Feature engineering (loads from `validated_file`)
5. Preprocessing (uses feature data)
6. Training (uses preprocessed data)
7. Evaluation
8. Prediction

## Testing

Successfully tested:
- ✅ Validation wrapper function imports correctly
- ✅ Validation stage handles missing columns gracefully
- ✅ Quality score calculation works (scored 0.844 on 5,000 record sample)
- ✅ Validated data and report files are created correctly
- ✅ Pipeline orchestrator can run validation stage without errors

## Next Steps

The validation stage is now fully functional and ready for integration into the full pipeline. You can now:
1. Run `python main.py` to execute the full pipeline
2. Run `python main.py --stage validate` to run just the validation stage
3. Proceed with implementing T032 (Feature Engineering data filtering)

## Files Modified
- `src/validation.py` - Added wrapper function and fixed column compatibility
- `src/pipeline_orchestrator.py` - Clarified data flow between stages
