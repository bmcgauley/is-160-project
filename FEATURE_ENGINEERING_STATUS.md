### ✗ NOT IMPLEMENTED (9/10 tasks)

These tasks are currently **stub implementations** that only log "[PENDING]" messages:

#### T033: Handle Annual vs Quarterly Records
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Required:** Filter/separate Annual-only vs quarterly records
- **Issue:** Dataset contains mix of `Annual` and quarterly (`Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3`, `Q4`) records
- **Impact:** Training needs consistent quarterly sequences

#### T034: Data Quality Filtering
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Required:** Remove incomplete/inconsistent records
- **Examples:**
  - Zero employment but non-zero establishments
  - Negative wage values
  - Impossible data combinations
- **Impact:** Poor quality data degrades model performance

#### T035: Central Valley Counties Subset
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Required:** Extract Central Valley counties for regional analysis
- **Data Source:** `data/central_valley_counties.json`
- **Impact:** Regional model cannot be trained

#### T036: All California Counties Processing
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Required:** Process all 58 counties with complete feature set
- **Dependencies:** T033, T034, T038-T042 must be complete first
- **Impact:** Feature-complete dataset not available

#### T038: Quarterly Growth Rates
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Required:** Calculate quarter-over-quarter employment growth
- **Formula:** `(current_quarter - previous_quarter) / previous_quarter`
- **Impact:** Model cannot learn growth patterns

#### T039: Seasonal Adjustments
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Required:** Create seasonal factors to remove cyclical patterns
- **Method:** Moving averages or classical decomposition
- **Impact:** Model may overfit seasonal noise

#### T040: Industry Concentration Metrics
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Required:** Calculate economic diversity indices (Herfindahl-Hirschman, etc.)
- **Purpose:** Measure employment concentration across industries
- **Impact:** Cannot model industry diversification effects

#### T041: Geographic Clustering
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Required:** Build employment similarity clusters across counties
- **Method:** K-means or hierarchical clustering
- **Impact:** Cannot leverage geographic patterns

#### T042: Lag Features
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Required:** Generate temporal dependencies (1, 2, 3, 4 quarters back)
- **Purpose:** Capture autoregressive patterns in employment
- **Impact:** Model cannot learn from recent history

- **Size:** 546.7 MB
- **Records:** 4,732,218
- **Columns:** 15 (original schema - no new features added)

## Preprocessing Status

### T054-T058: Preprocessing Pipeline

**Status:** Structure exists but core functions return empty/placeholder data

#### Issues Identified:

1. **T057: `transform_to_sequences()` NOT IMPLEMENTED**
   ```python
   # Current implementation (preprocessing.py line 100):
   return np.array([]), np.array([])  # Returns empty arrays!
   ```
   - Result: Sequences shape = (0,), Targets shape = (0,)
   - Impact: Cannot train LSTM model without sequences

2. **Value Unpacking Error**
   ```python
   # preprocessing_pipeline.py returns 3 values:
   return X_tensor, y_tensor, preprocessor
   
   # pipeline_orchestrator.py line 195 expects 2:
   df_processed, preprocessor = self.stage_5_preprocessing(df_features)
   ```
   - Result: ValueError: "too many values to unpack (expected 2)"
   - Impact: Pipeline crashes at Stage 5

3. **Normalization/Encoding: Structure only**
   - normalize_employment_data(): Logs message, returns df unchanged
   - handle_missing_values(): Logs message, returns df unchanged
   - create_categorical_encodings(): Logs message, returns df unchanged

---

## Critical Path to Model Training

### Must implement in this order:

1. **FIX PREPROCESSING VALUE UNPACKING** ⚠️ BLOCKING
   - Line 195 in pipeline_orchestrator.py
   - Change to: `X_tensor, y_tensor, preprocessor = self.stage_5_preprocessing(df_features)`

2. **IMPLEMENT T057: Sequence Transformation** ⚠️ BLOCKING
   - Create sliding window sequences of length 12
   - Group by county + industry
   - Sort by year + quarter
   - Return (sequences, targets) as numpy arrays

3. **IMPLEMENT FEATURE ENGINEERING T033-T042**
   - These create the features LSTM needs to learn from
   - Order matters: T033→T034→T038→T039→T040→T041→T042→T035→T036

4. **IMPLEMENT PREPROCESSING T054-T056**
   - Normalization using RobustScaler
   - Imputation using median strategy
   - Categorical encoding using LabelEncoder

## Next Steps

1. Fix preprocessing value unpacking error (1 line change)
2. Implement T057 sequence transformation (critical for LSTM)
3. Implement feature engineering tasks T033-T042 (in order)
4. Implement preprocessing tasks T054-T056 (normalization, imputation, encoding)
5. Test full pipeline end-to-end

**Estimated Effort:**
- Fix value unpacking: 2 minutes
- T057 sequence transformation: 30 minutes
- Feature engineering T033-T042: 4-6 hours
- Preprocessing T054-T056: 2-3 hours
- Testing and validation: 1-2 hours

**Total:** ~8-12 hours of implementation work
