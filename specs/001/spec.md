# Feature Specification: Build a Convolutional Neural Network for Employment Trends Analysis

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-convolutional`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a convolutional neural network using PyTorch to analyze and predict employment trends from California's Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data. The CNN should process multi-dimensional employment data including temporal patterns, geographic distributions, and industry classifications to predict quarterly employment changes, wage growth, or economic indicators. Include comprehensive feature engineering for employment metrics, data validation pipelines for economic data quality, and CNN architectures adapted for tabular time-series data with proper evaluation against employment forecasting baselines."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data analyst or economist, I want to build and deploy a convolutional neural network that analyzes California's QCEW data to predict employment trends, so that I can provide accurate forecasts of economic indicators for policy and business decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** QCEW data for California across multiple quarters, **When** the system processes the multi-dimensional data including temporal, geographic, and industry dimensions, **Then** it generates predictions for quarterly employment changes with measurable accuracy metrics.
2. **Given** raw employment metrics, **When** the system performs feature engineering, **Then** it creates meaningful features that capture economic relationships and temporal dynamics.
3. **Given** economic data inputs, **When** the system validates data quality, **Then** it identifies and handles data anomalies, missing values, and inconsistencies automatically.
4. **Given** processed tabular time-series data, **When** the CNN architecture processes the data, **Then** it produces predictions that outperform specified baseline forecasting methods.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when QCEW data is missing for certain geographic regions or time periods?
- How does the system handle extreme outliers in employment counts or wage data?
- What occurs when industry classifications change or are restructured in the data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST process QCEW data including temporal patterns, geographic distributions, and industry classifications
- **FR-002**: System MUST perform comprehensive feature engineering on employment metrics to create predictive features
- **FR-003**: System MUST include automated data validation pipelines that ensure economic data quality and integrity
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement CNN architectures specifically adapted for tabular time-series data structures
- **FR-005**: System MUST predict quarterly employment changes
- **FR-006**: System MUST evaluate prediction performance against established employment forecasting baselines (ARIMA, linear regression, random forest)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Employment Record**: Represents quarterly employment data with attributes including industry classification, geographic location, employment count, wage information, and time period
- **Feature Set**: Engineered features derived from raw employment data, capturing temporal trends, geographic patterns, and industry relationships
- **Prediction Model**: The CNN model that processes feature sets and generates employment trend predictions
- **Validation Report**: Automated assessment of data quality including completeness, consistency, and anomaly detection results
