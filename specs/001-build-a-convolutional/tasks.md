# Tasks: Build a Convolutional Neural Network for Employment Trends Analysis

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-a-convolutional/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md (available), plan.md (not yet created), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Parallel Execution Examples
Tasks that can run in parallel (marked [P]) are limited in this sequential workflow, but some setup tasks can be parallelized:

- T001, T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel as they set up independent components
- T005-T009 can run in parallel within the exploration phase
- T010-T014 can run in parallel for validation development
- T015-T029 can run in parallel for feature engineering development
- T030-T034 can run in parallel for preprocessing development
- T035-T039 can run in parallel for model architecture development
- T040-T044 can run in parallel for dataset development
- T045-T049 can run in parallel for training infrastructure
- T050-T054 can run in parallel for loss/metrics development
- T055-T059 can run in parallel for evaluation development
- T060-T064 can run in parallel for visualization development
- T065-T069 can run in parallel for baseline comparison
- T070-T074 can run in parallel for documentation

## Dependency Graph
All tasks follow a strict sequential dependency:
Setup (T001-T004) → Data Exploration (T005-T009) → Validation (T010-T014) → Feature Engineering (T015-T029) → Preprocessing (T030-T034) → Architecture (T035-T039) → Dataset (T040-T044) → Training (T045-T049) → Loss/Metrics (T050-T054) → Evaluation (T055-T059) → Visualization (T060-T064) → Baselines (T065-T069) → Documentation (T070-T074)

No tasks can be executed out of this order due to data dependencies and iterative refinement requirements.
