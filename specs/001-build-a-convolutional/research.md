# Research: Build a Convolutional Neural Network for Employment Trends Analysis

**Date**: 2025-09-24
**Researcher**: AI Assistant
**Scope**: Technical feasibility and approach for CNN-based employment trend prediction

## Executive Summary
This research establishes the technical foundation for building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze and predict employment trends from California's Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data. The approach adapts computer vision CNN techniques to tabular time-series data, focusing on spatio-temporal patterns in employment data.

## Technical Approach

### Core Architecture Decision
**CNN for Tabular Time-Series Data**: Traditional CNNs process 2D image grids, but employment data is tabular with temporal and geographic dimensions. We'll adapt CNNs by:
- Treating time as one dimension (1D convolutions for temporal patterns)
- Treating geography as another dimension (2D convolutions for spatial patterns)
- Combining both for spatio-temporal feature learning

**Justification**: CNNs excel at learning hierarchical patterns and local dependencies, which are present in employment data (local economic effects, temporal trends). This approach has shown promise in recent papers on spatio-temporal forecasting.

### Data Processing Pipeline
**Input Data**: QCEW provides quarterly employment counts, wages, and industry classifications by county/geographic area.

**Transformation Strategy**:
1. **Feature Engineering**: Create employment indicators, growth rates, seasonal adjustments
2. **Tensor Conversion**: Reshape tabular data into 3D tensors (time × geography × features)
3. **Normalization**: Robust scaling to handle outliers in employment data
4. **Validation**: Statistical tests for data quality and temporal consistency

**Rationale**: Employment data has unique characteristics (seasonality, outliers, spatial autocorrelation) requiring domain-specific preprocessing.

### Model Architecture
**Hybrid CNN Design**:
- **Temporal Layer**: 1D CNN for quarterly patterns and seasonality
- **Spatial Layer**: 2D CNN for geographic employment correlations
- **Fusion Layer**: Combine temporal and spatial features
- **Prediction Head**: Dense layers for employment change prediction

**Hyperparameters**: 
- Kernel sizes: 3-5 for temporal, 3×3 for spatial
- Channels: 32-128 progressively
- Activation: ReLU with batch normalization

### Implementation Stack
**Core Framework**: PyTorch for modular, research-friendly deep learning
**Data Manipulation**: pandas for efficient tabular data handling
**Preprocessing**: scikit-learn for scaling, encoding, and validation
**Visualization**: matplotlib/seaborn for employment trend analysis
**Logging**: Python logging for reproducible research tracking

**Why This Stack**: PyTorch provides excellent debugging and research capabilities. pandas/scikit-learn are industry standards for data science. The combination ensures both performance and ease of development.

### Validation and Evaluation
**Baseline Comparison**: ARIMA, linear regression, random forest for traditional forecasting
**Metrics**: MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), directional accuracy, RMSE
**Cross-Validation**: Time-series split preserving temporal order
**Statistical Tests**: Diebold-Mariano test for forecast comparison

### Risk Assessment
**Technical Risks**:
- CNN may not outperform simpler models on this structured data
- Overfitting to historical patterns
- Computational complexity for large geographic areas

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive baseline comparison
- Regularization techniques (dropout, early stopping)
- Progressive model complexity testing

**Data Risks**:
- Missing quarters or geographic areas
- Industry classification changes
- Economic shocks (COVID, recessions)

**Mitigation**:
- Robust imputation and validation
- Temporal consistency checks
- Domain expert review of anomalies

## Research Findings

### Literature Review
- **Spatio-Temporal CNNs**: Recent work shows CNNs effective for traffic prediction, weather forecasting
- **Employment Forecasting**: Traditional methods (ARIMA, VAR) dominate, but ML approaches gaining traction
- **California QCEW**: High-quality, comprehensive employment data with geographic granularity

### Feasibility Assessment
**Data Availability**: QCEW data is publicly available, well-documented
**Computational Requirements**: Feasible on modern hardware (GPU recommended for training)
**Accuracy Potential**: Expected to improve on baselines for complex spatio-temporal patterns
**Implementation Timeline**: 2-3 months for complete pipeline

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Primary Prediction Target**: Quarterly employment changes (most actionable for policy/business)
2. **Baseline Methods**: ARIMA (time-series standard), linear regression (interpretable), random forest (non-linear baseline)
3. **Evaluation Horizon**: 1-4 quarters ahead (balancing accuracy and utility)
4. **Geographic Resolution**: County level (sufficient granularity without excessive sparsity)

## Next Steps
1. Data acquisition and initial exploration
2. Baseline model implementation
3. CNN architecture prototyping
4. Comparative evaluation
5. Model refinement and documentation
